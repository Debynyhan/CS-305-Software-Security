Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that specializes in developing personalized financial plans for its clients. As such, the value of secure communications to the company is paramount as it deals with sensitive financial information. This includes secure communication both internally and externally to ensure the protection of customer data. As a financial firm, Artemis Financial will conduct transactions with clients both domestically and internationally, thus it is important to consider international regulations and laws regarding data privacy and secure communications. Additionally, the company handles financial information and proprietary client data such as social security numbers, and account information. The need for data masking when storing and transmitting is critical. External threats may be present now and in the immediate future including hacking, phishing, and malware attacks. Artemis Financial must also consider the modernization requirements such as the role of open-source libraries and evolving web application technologies. Web applications inherently have their own vulnerabilities, which is why there are guidelines and best practices regarding web application risk management. 
It is important to code securely for several reasons such as, if your code is not secure, it can be vulnerable to attacks that allow hackers to steal user data, such as login credentials, personal information, and financial data. By writing secure code, you can protect user data and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Secure code helps ensure that the system is functioning as intended and that there are no vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. This is particularly important in systems critical to society's functioning, such as healthcare systems or financial institutions. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks, it is more important than ever to write secure code. Attackers are constantly searching for vulnerabilities in software and exploiting them to gain access to systems or steal data. By writing secure code, you can make it more difficult for attackers to penetrate your system. In many industries, there are regulations that require software to be developed in a secure manner. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires that all software that processes credit card data be developed securely. 
The Process of adding security layers to an application began with understanding the client requirements. After understanding the application requirements, I identified potential threats and vulnerabilities from a manual review of the code. Additionally, I ran a dependency check to identify any known vulnerabilities and potential threats to the application.The next step involved reviewing financial sector policies and practices to ensure compliance with laws. I started working on the security-related area of the project once I fully understood its scope. I referenced the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram and searched for any potential security holes to add security layers to the application. Then I designed effective security measures to protect the application from the threats I identified in security assessment. 
After refactoring the code, I ran another dependency check to see whether I had introduced additional vulnerabilities. Refactoring can sometimes introduce new bugs, or even create new security vulnerabilities. By running a dependency check, I was able to identify any potential unforeseen issues before they caused any problems. 
Writing secure code is an essential aspect of software development. Here are some resources, tools, and coding practices that help me write secure code: Follow established secure coding standards such as OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), or NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). These standards provide guidelines on secure coding practices that you can use to ensure that your code is secure. Conduct code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities in your code. Code reviews can help you find flaws in your code, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Perform penetration testing to identify weaknesses in your software. Penetration testing involves attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in your software to determine whether they are exploitable. Use encryption to protect sensitive data. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access to your data, by encoding it in a way that only authorized parties can decode. Validate all user input to prevent malicious input from causing harm. Input validation ensures that the data entered into your application meets the expected criteria, such as data type, length, and format. 
Use security libraries and frameworks such as bcrypt, OpenSSL, and SSL/TLS to help secure your application. These libraries and frameworks provide built-in security features such as authentication, access control, and encryption. Limit access to sensitive data and functionality to authorized users only. Furthermore, implementing access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and functionality. Keep software up to date to ensure that security patches are applied promptly. Regular updates can help mitigate vulnerabilities in your software and prevent attackers from exploiting them. Secure coding is an ongoing process that requires continuous effort and attention. By following best practices and using appropriate tools and resources, I was able to minimize the risk of security breaches and protect the software and data. 
 
An excellent example of how to use best practices for secure coding can be found in this project. Using the project, I would demonstrate to potential employers that I understand the fundamentals of secure coding. By following established coding guidelines and using secure libraries, the project ensured the code was secure against potential attackers. Additionally, the code was tested regularly to ensure that it was still secure, and no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
